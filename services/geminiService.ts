   - **NEUTRAL POSE:** Reposition arms to a relaxed, neutral state at the sides. Remove any hand-to-face contact.

3. **PROFESSIONAL COMPOSITION & BACKGROUND:**
   - **FRAMING:** Create a professional half-body portrait (head to approximately waist level), perfectly centered.
   - **BACKGROUND:** Replace the original background with a solid, neutral light gray or soft off-white, consistent with official documentation standards. Apply a subtle, professional bokeh effect.

4. **STUDIO-QUALITY LIGHTING & ENHANCEMENT:**
   - **LIGHTING:** Apply a professional, even studio lighting setup suitable for an executive headshot. Eliminate harsh shadows while maintaining natural facial modeling.
   - **QUALITY:** If the original is low quality, enhance sharpness, correct color, and remove noise, but ONLY after all preservation rules are met.

    -   **EXACT REPLICATION, NOT INTERPRETATION:** Your primary task is to perfectly replicate this exact face onto each of the new poses. Do not interpret, re-render, or create a "similar" face. You are compositing the original face onto new bodies.
    -   **PIXEL-LEVEL FIDELITY:** The subject's bone structure, skin texture, unique features (moles, scars), and the precise shape and spacing of the eyes, nose, and mouth must be 100% identical to the source image.
    -   **FAILURE CONDITION:** Any deviation in facial identity, however minor, constitutes a complete failure of the task. The person in all generated poses must be instantly and perfectly recognizable as the person in the input image. This rule overrides all other stylistic instructions.

2.  **PROFESSIONAL COLLAGE COMPOSITION (STRICT LAYOUT RULES):**
    -   **Single Composite Output:** Generate a single, vertically-oriented composite image.
    -   **MANDATORY TRANSPARENT BACKGROUNDS:** Each of the four poses MUST be generated with a perfectly transparent background.
    -   **FINAL COMPOSITE:** These four transparent-background poses must then be arranged on a single, clean, solid #FFFFFF white canvas.
    -   **NO OVERLAPPING (CRITICAL):** The bounding boxes of the four generated poses MUST NOT overlap under any circumstances. There must be clear, visible white space separating each distinct image. Do not allow any part of one pose to obscure any part of another. This is a strict requirement for a clean, professional layout.
    -   **Dynamic Layout:** Within the no-overlapping constraint, create a sophisticated and balanced, magazine-quality arrangement. Avoid a simple, rigid grid.

3.  **INDUSTRY-STANDARD FOUR POSES:**
    -   **Main Headshot:** Professional studio headshot (shoulders up) with perfect facial clarity.
    -   **Full-Body Studio Shot:** Complete standing pose showcasing full physique and proportions.
    -   **Three-Quarter Length:** Professional shot from knees up in a complementary pose.
    -   **Profile Shot:** Clean side-view profile highlighting facial structure and bone definition.

4.  **PROFESSIONAL WARDROBE STYLING:**
    -   **Consistent Athletic Wear:** Replace original clothing with sophisticated, form-fitting athletic or swimwear.
    -   **Male Styling:** Premium athletic shorts, briefs, or fitted athletic wear showcasing physique.
    -   **Female Styling:** Professional sports bra and shorts, unitard, or elegant bikini highlighting body lines.
    -   **Physique Showcase:** Attire must clearly display muscle definition, body shape, and proportions.
    -   **Cohesive Aesthetic:** Maintain consistent styling across all four poses for professional unity.

5.  **TECHNICAL MODEL STATISTICS (DATA ANALYSIS):**
    Based on visual analysis of the original photograph, generate realistic professional modeling statistics:
    -   **Height:** Estimate in both feet/inches and centimeters.
    -   **Measurements:** Professional Bust-Waist-Hips measurements in inches.
    -   **Physical Attributes:** Hair color and eye color analysis.
    -   **Shoe Size:** US sizing estimation.
    -   **Typography:** Clean, minimalist text block positioning at the bottom of the composite.

6.  **FASHION INDUSTRY QUALITY STANDARDS:**
    -   **Magazine-Grade Photography:** Each pose must meet Vogue/Elle publication standards.
    -   **Professional Lighting:** Apply high-fashion studio lighting techniques.
    -   **Model Agency Quality:** Ensure composite meets top-tier agency submission requirements.
    -   **Commercial Viability:** Create a comp card suitable for Fashion Week casting submissions.

**PROFESSIONAL SAFETY STANDARDS:**
-   Preserve authentic ethnic characteristics while achieving fashion industry presentation standards.
-   Maintain subject dignity and professional modeling industry ethics.
-   Ensure all poses meet international modeling agency standards.

**OUTPUT DIRECTIVE:** Return exclusively the final single composite image featuring four professional poses with a statistics block, meeting all specified international modeling agency standards.`;

    -   **Technical Clarity:** Provide clear, unobstructed view of physique and body structure

    -   The final image MUST feature the **exact same person** from the **[SUBJECT IMAGE]**.
    -   You are forbidden from using the person, face, body, or hair from the **[REFERENCE IMAGE]**. Using the person from the reference image is a complete failure of this task.
    -   Preserve the facial features, bone structure, ethnicity, unique characteristics, and hairstyle from the **[SUBJECT IMAGE]** with 100% accuracy.

2.  **CLOTHING EXTRACTION ONLY:**
    -   The **[REFERENCE IMAGE]** is to be used **exclusively** as a source for the clothing/outfit.
    -   You MUST completely **ignore** the person, face, body, hair, pose, and background of the **[REFERENCE IMAGE]**.

**IMAGE ROLES:**
-   **[SUBJECT IMAGE]:** The source of truth for the **PERSON**. You will use this person's face, hair, and body.
-   **[REFERENCE IMAGE]:** The source of truth for the **CLOTHING**. You will only use the outfit from this image.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  Identify the person in the **[SUBJECT IMAGE]**.
2.  Identify the complete outfit in the **[REFERENCE IMAGE]**.
3.  Create a new, photorealistic image showing the person from the **[SUBJECT IMAGE]** wearing the outfit from the **[REFERENCE IMAGE]**.
4.  The pose and background can be changed to best suit the new clothing, creating a natural and visually appealing composition. The new pose should be realistic and flattering.
5.  ${userPrompt ? `Apply the following user instructions: "${userPrompt}"` : ''}

**FINAL CHECK:** Does the output image contain the person from the [SUBJECT IMAGE]? If not, you have failed. The person from the [REFERENCE IMAGE] must not appear in the output.

**OUTPUT DIRECTIVE:** Return only the final, photorealistic image of the subject wearing the new clothes.`;

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
1.  **CONTENT PRESERVATION:** The final image must contain the **exact same subjects, objects, and composition** as the [CONTENT IMAGE]. Do not add, remove, or change the arrangement of elements. If a person is present, their identity, clothing, and pose must remain unchanged.
2.  **STYLE TRANSFER ONLY:** You are only transferring the aesthetic (color palette, lighting, texture, brush strokes, etc.), not the content, from the [STYLE IMAGE].

**IMAGE ROLES:**
-   **[CONTENT IMAGE]:** This image provides the scene, subjects, and composition to be preserved.
-   **[STYLE IMAGE]:** This image provides the complete artistic style to be applied.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  Re-render the [CONTENT IMAGE] with the exact artistic style of the [STYLE IMAGE].
2.  This includes a faithful transfer of color grading, lighting, texture, and overall mood.
3.  ${userPrompt ? `Apply the following user instructions to fine-tune the transfer: "${userPrompt}"` : ''}

1.  **FACIAL IDENTITY PRESERVATION:** The person in the final image MUST have the **exact same face** and identity as the person in the [SUBJECT IMAGE]. Do not alter their facial features, bone structure, or ethnicity.
2.  **SEAMLESS INTEGRATION:** The final result must be a single, cohesive, and photorealistic image. The lighting, shadows, perspective, and scale of the subject must perfectly match the new environment.

**IMAGE ROLES:**
-   **[SUBJECT IMAGE]:** This image provides the person/object to be placed in the new scene.
-   **[SCENE IMAGE]:** This image provides the new background and environment.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  Seamlessly and realistically composite the person from the [SUBJECT IMAGE] into the environment from the [SCENE IMAGE].
2.  The subject's clothing and hairstyle **MAY BE MODIFIED** to logically fit the new scene (e.g., a winter coat in a snowy scene, a swimsuit at a beach).
3.  The lighting on the subject MUST be re-rendered to match the lighting of the new scene.
4.  ${userPrompt ? `Apply the following user instructions for the composition: "${userPrompt}"` : ''}
