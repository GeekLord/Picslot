- **AI Prompt Enhancer**: A one-click tool that uses AI to rewrite and improve your prompts, adding professional details to help you achieve better results.
- **Creative Filters**: Instantly transform your photos with a range of artistic filters like Synthwave, Anime, and Lomo, or create a unique look with a custom text prompt.
- **Professional Adjustments**: Apply global enhancements like blurring the background for a portrait effect, adding studio lighting, or adjusting the color temperature for a warmer feel.
- **Non-Destructive Workflow**:
  - **Undo/Redo**: Full history tracking allows you to step backward and forward through your edits.
  - **Compare Mode**: A dynamic slider lets you instantly compare your current edit with the original image.

### ü§ñ One-Click AI Superpowers

Picslot leverages advanced generative AI for complex tasks that traditionally require expert skills:

- **Auto Enhance**: A single click improves your image's lighting, color balance, sharpness, and overall clarity.
- **Remove Background**: Instantly removes the background from your photo, leaving a clean, transparent cutout.
- **Restore Image**: Magically repair old, blurry, or damaged photos, removing scratches and restoring faded colors.
- **Studio Portrait**: Convert any casual photo into a professional, forward-facing headshot with a neutral studio background, while preserving the subject's identity.
- **Full Body Outpainting**: Expands a cropped photo to a full-body shot with a plausible, AI-generated background that matches the original context.
- **Comp Card Generator**: Automatically create a professional, multi-pose modeling composite card, complete with estimated stats, styled in form-fitting athletic wear.
- **3-View Shot Generator**: Produce a technical three-view (front, side, back) full-body reference shot, ideal for character design or fashion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend-as-a-Service**: Supabase (Authentication, PostgreSQL Database, Storage)
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` model)
- **Core Libraries**:
  - `react-image-crop` for the interactive cropping UI.
- **Bundling**: The project is set up to run directly in the browser using ES Modules and an `importmap`, requiring no local bundling or installation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Picslot's magic lies in its sophisticated prompt engineering and robust cloud architecture.

1.  **Authentication**: Users sign up and log in securely via Supabase Auth. Sessions are managed with industry-standard practices.
2.  **User Action**: The user uploads an image and selects a tool (e.g., "Restore Image").
3.  **Prompt Engineering**: A highly specific prompt is generated, instructing the Gemini model to act as a professional (e.g., "a world-class master conservator") and follow strict rules about identity preservation and technical execution.
4.  **API Request**: The image data and the engineered prompt are sent to the Gemini API.
5.  **Response Handling**: The application receives the AI-generated image and displays it.
6.  **Cloud Sync**: When a user saves a project, each image in the history stack is uploaded to Supabase Storage. The project metadata, including the storage paths to the images, is saved to a PostgreSQL database. This ensures data is persistent, secure, and accessible across sessions.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account (free tier is sufficient).
- A Google Gemini API key, available from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Supabase Configuration

1.  **Create a Supabase Project:**
    -   Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/) and create a new project.
    -   Save your database password securely.

2.  **Get API Credentials:**
    -   In your new project, navigate to **Project Settings** (the gear icon) > **API**.
    -   Find your **Project URL** and your **`anon` public key**. You will need these for the next step.

3.  **Enable Auth Providers:**
    -   Navigate to **Authentication** > **Providers**.
    -   Enable the **Email** provider (it's usually on by default, but confirm "Confirm email" is enabled).
    -   Enable the **Google** provider. You will need to provide a Client ID and Secret, which you can get from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Follow the Supabase documentation for the exact steps.

4.  **Set Up Database Table:**
    -   Go to the **SQL Editor** in the Supabase dashboard.
    -   Click **+ New query**.
    -   Paste and run the following SQL to create the `projects` table:
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE public.projects (
            id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
            user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
            name TEXT NOT NULL,
            history JSONB NOT NULL,
            history_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
            thumbnail TEXT NOT NULL,
            created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
            updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
        );

        ALTER TABLE public.projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

        CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own projects"
        ON public.projects
        FOR ALL
        USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
        WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
        ```
    -   Return to the SQL Editor, create another new query, and run the following SQL to create the `prompts` table for the new Prompt Manager feature:
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE public.prompts (
            id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
            user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
            title TEXT NOT NULL,
            prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
            created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
            updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
        );

        ALTER TABLE public.prompts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

        CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own prompts"
        ON public.prompts
        FOR ALL
        USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
        WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
        ```

5.  **Set Up Storage:**
    -   Go to the **Storage** section in the Supabase dashboard.
    -   Create a new bucket named `project-images`. **This name must be exact.**
    -   Make the bucket **private**.
    -   Go to the policies for the `project-images` bucket and create a new policy with the following rules to allow users to manage their own files:
        -   **Policy Name**: `User can manage their own project images`
        -   **Allowed operations**: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
        -   **Target roles**: `authenticated`
        -   **USING expression**: `bucket_id = 'project-images' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]`
        -   **WITH CHECK expression**: `bucket_id = 'project-images' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]`

### Local Application Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/picslot.git
    cd picslot
    ```

2.  **Set Up API Keys:**
    The application loads API keys from environment variables. For simple local development without a build tool, you can add them to a script tag in `index.html`.
    
    **Important:** In a real production environment, you would use a build tool like Vite or Next.js to manage environment variables securely. Do not commit your API keys to version control.

    Open `index.html` and find the `window.process` script object. Replace the placeholder values with your actual keys from Google AI Studio and Supabase.
    ```html
    <script>
      window.process = {
        env: {
          // IMPORTANT: Replace with your actual keys
          API_KEY: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE",
          SUPABASE_URL: "YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL_HERE",
          SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: "YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY_HERE"
        }
      };
    </script>
    ```

3.  **Run the Application:**
    Since this project uses modern browser features and no build step, you can run it with any simple local web server. If you have Node.js installed, you can use `serve`:
    
    First, install `serve`:
    ```bash
    npm install -g serve
    ```
    Then, run it from the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    serve
    ```

4.  **Access the App:**
    Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by the server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). You should see the login screen.
